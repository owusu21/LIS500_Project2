      Implicit bias shapes our perceptions and decisions in ways we may not consciously realize, often reinforcing societal patterns of privilege and discrimination.
      The Implicit Bias Test (IBT) helps uncover these hidden associations, sometimes revealing biases that contradict our conscious beliefs.
      Intersectionality further expands this understanding by showing how overlapping identities‚Äîsuch as race, gender, class, and ability‚Äîintersect to create unique experiences of advantage or oppression.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: center; max-width: 800px; margin: auto;">
      Intersectionality explores structural inequality and injustice shaped by systems of power in a perspective to view race, sex, ableism, and other aspects that do not operate in isolation. 
      Instead, they overlap, reinforcing and compounding disadvantages for such groups. Through it, an understanding is gained on how these systems interact, leading to unique forms of 
      inequality that cannot be fully explained by looking at single categories alone.
      Structural inequalities also manifest in areas like healthcare, education, and the criminal justice system. 
      Low-income women of color, for instance, are disproportionately affected by disparities in maternal healthcare 
      due to both racial bias in medicine and economic barriers to quality care.

      <h3>Professor Kimberl√© Crenshaw Defines Intersectionality</h3>
      <p style="text-align: center; max-width: 800px; margin: auto; padding-bottom: 20px;">
        Many years ago, Prof. Crenshaw began to use the term "intersectionality" to deal with the fact that many of our social justice problems 
        like racism and sexism are often overlapping, creating multiple levels of social injustice. 
        Listen to her story of how an encounter with an African American woman put this definition into perspective

        Watch author, speaker and CEO, Valerie Alexander, explain how the human brain instinctively reacts when encountering the unexpected, 
        like saber-toothed tigers or female tech execs. She proposes that if we have the courage to examine our own behavior when faced with the unfamiliar, 
        we can take control of our expectations

    <h2>üß™ Take The IBT</h2>
    <p style="text-align: center; max-width: 800px; margin: auto; padding-bottom: 20px;">
      The IAT (Implicit Association Test) is a series of online tests designed to measure the unconscious associations you make to characterize races, genders, sexual identities, and more.
      The IAT was developed by social psychologists at Harvard University, the University of Virginia, and the University of Washington. 
      The test forms the basis for Project Implicit, an international non-profit with a mission to educate and collect data on implicit (or ‚Äúunconscious‚Äù) bias.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: center; max-width: 800px; margin: auto; padding-bottom: 20px;">
      When you take the IAT, you are asked to quickly sort words and images onto the left and right sides of your computer screen.  
      Depending on the test you take, the images are of people who represent different races, ages, genders, etc. 
      The words are either positive (‚Äúhappy,‚Äù ‚Äúattractive‚Äù) or negative (‚Äúangry,‚Äù ‚Äúfailure‚Äù).
