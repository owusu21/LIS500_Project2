    <img src="annies-picture.jpg" alt="A photo of Annie smiling with green foliage behind her.">
    <p1>Annie is currently living in Minneapolis, MN working a special education teacher. 
      She is a graduate student studying library and information studies. In her free time
      she enjoys reading, playing video games, and crocheting. Annie is taking this course 
      becuase she has a love for technology having started undergrad as a computer science
      major. She then changed to an elementary education major to connect more with people.
      Now she wants to combine the two in her graduate studies and hopes this course will
      help to provide a human perspective to technology.</p1>
