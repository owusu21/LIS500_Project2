    <p>Annie is currently living in Minneapolis, MN working a special education teacher. 
      She is a graduate student studying library and information studies. In her free time
      she enjoys reading, playing video games, and crocheting. Annie is taking this course 
      becuase she has a love for technology having started undergrad as a computer science
      major. She then changed to an elementary education major to connect more with people.
      Now she wants to combine the two in her graduate studies and hopes this course will
      help to provide a human perspective to technology.</p>

        <p> RaeAnna is currently a sophomore at the University of Wisconsin-Madison studying 
        Legal Studies and Information Science. Originally from Ellsworth, Wisconsin, she enjoys music, excercising, and dance! 
        She is interested in exploring the intersection between tech and law. She took this class 
        because she is interested in exploring how disparities are present in technology and can affect 
        the way we use technology while gaining skills with different computing projects. As a new student
        in the iSchool, she has felt the pressures of being intimated in classes made up of mostly men, which
        has made her curious about the disparities in the field. She believes this class perfectly blends her sociological 
        academic studies with her technical ones.</p>

        <div class="bio-text">
        <p> Nate is a scenior studying computer science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. 
          Funny enough, in his first interaction with coding, he grew a strong dislike for it. But being encouraged by his game design teacher, 
          he decided to push through and developed a love-hate relationship with anything computer-science related. Fueled by his desire to put his 
          skills to the furthering of the community around him, he seeks to impact the community around him in a positive light.
          When he's not behing a computer, his interests include basketball, volleyball, video games, and playing bass guitar.
