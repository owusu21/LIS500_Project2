    <div class="bio-text">
    <p>Annie is currently living in Minneapolis, MN working a special education teacher. 
      She is a graduate student studying library and information studies. In her free time
      she enjoys reading, playing video games, and crocheting. Annie is taking this course 
      becuase she has a love for technology having started undergrad as a computer science
      major. She then changed to an elementary education major to connect more with people.
      Now she wants to combine the two in her graduate studies and hopes this course will
      help to provide a human perspective to technology.</p>

<!-- About RaeAnna -->
    <h2>RaeAnna</h2>
   <!----not done----> <img scr="raeannasmith.jpg" alt="A photo of RaeAnna smiling while standing on the Stillwater Bridge.">
        <div class="bio-text">
        <p> RaeAnna is currently a sophomore at the University of Wisconsin-Madison studying 
        Legal Studies and Information Science. Originally from Ellsworth, Wisconsin, she enjoys music, excercising, and dance! 
        She is interested in exploring the intersection between tech and law. She took this class 
        because she is interested in exploring how disparities are present in technology and can affect 
        the way we use technology while gaining skills with different computing projects. As a new student
        in the iSchool, she has felt the pressures of being intimated in classes made up of mostly men, which
        has made her curious about the disparities in the field. She believes this class perfectly blends her sociological 
        academic studies with her technical ones.</p>
