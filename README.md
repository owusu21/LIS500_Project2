# Project 2: Developing Projects Website  

This project expands upon Project 1 by building a fully developed multipage website using HTML and CSS. It will feature multiple sections, including introductions, an about page, a resource guide on implicit bias, and a profile of a tech leader making an impact. This project encourages both technical skill development and critical engagement with social issues in technology.  

## Key Features  

- **Welcome Page (`index.html`)** – The landing page that introduces visitors to your work and sets the tone for the site.  
- **Global Stylesheet (`stylepage.css`)** – A unified CSS file to ensure design consistency across all pages.  
- **About Me Page** – A dedicated page for introductions, adapted from Project 1.  
- **Resource Page** – A well-structured guide on implicit bias, intersectionality, and the Implicit Bias Test (IBT), including explanations and helpful resources 
- **Tech Hero Profile** – A biography and resource links for a person advancing equity in the tech industry, highlighting their contributions.  

## Timeline  

- **Feb 18** – First iteration uploaded (URL and screenshot submission).  
- **Feb 21** – Peer feedback due (constructive reviews on two other students' sites).
