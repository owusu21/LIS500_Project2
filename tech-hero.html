			<!--MAIN BIOGRAPHY--seperated in paragraphs as intended to easy style--->

			<p> Inspired by her unique background in music, we chose Aniyia Williams as our tech hero. A creator, tech innovator and entrepreneur, Aniyia Williams is an inspiration who advocates for racial and gender equity in the tech industry. Currently she is a director on the Responsible Technology team at Omidyar Network, and works towards making the tech world better for everyone.</p>

			<p>Prior to her current role, she founded a fashion tech company, Tinsel, in response to the lack of electronics developed for women by women. She co-founded Zebras Unite, a movement focused on creating a community for ethical and sustainable startups. She also founded Black & Brown Founders, a nonprofit that works to help Black and Latinx entrepreneurs launch tech businesses. Additionally, she is the co-founder of the Firefly Alliance, a community that develops collaborative leadership skills for women to move beyond racism and sexism. Aniyia Williams not only has created successful businesses within the tech industry, but actively works towards making tech responsible and prioritizing community, well-being, diversity, and sustainability.
			</p>

			<p> Aniyia received a B.A. in music, with minors in business and Italian from Penn State University, and then went on to work in major gifts fundraising for arts nonprofits in the DC area, where she met her husband. Her husband is a web developer who introduced her to tech, which inspired her to find her own role in tech at a startup called Voxer. She left Voxer to pursue her idea of Tinsel. Her experiences through this journey led to her personal understanding of the serious inequities that exist for women and people of color in tech, and began her commitment to changing the system of oppression and discrimination. 
			</p>

			<p>By contributing to bettering the tech world, Aniyia is constantly making progress to advance equity for race, class, and gender in the United States and the entire industry. Additionally, her background in music and creative industries is a powerful reminder that a traditional technical background is not necessary to succeed in tech, as diverse backgrounds are an important asset in the tech space. Her story inspires those who may not see themselves as 'tech people' to break barriers and create their own path. She also inspires marginalized groups in the tech industry to continue to persevere and succeed. She is a strong mentor by providing guidance to the startup industry while addressing systemic barriers through many of her companies. By redefining success in entrepreneurship and advocating for inclusivity and equity in tech, Aniyia Williams creates pathways for underrepresented voices to lead impactful companies.
