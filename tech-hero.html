			<!--Aniyia Williams - MAIN BIOGRAPHY--seperated in paragraphs as intended to easy style--->
			<div class="column-right">
			<p> Inspired by her unique background in music, we chose Aniyia Williams as our first tech hero. 
				A creator, tech innovator and entrepreneur, Aniyia Williams is an inspiration who advocates 
				for racial and gender equity in the tech industry. Currently she is a director on the 
				Responsible Technology team at Omidyar Network, and works towards making the tech world 
				better for everyone.
			</p>

			<p>Prior to her current role, she founded a fashion tech company, Tinsel, in response to the 
				lack of electronics developed for women by women. She co-founded Zebras Unite, a movement 
				focused on creating a community for ethical and sustainable startups. She also founded 
				Black & Brown Founders, a nonprofit that works to help Black and Latinx entrepreneurs launch
				tech businesses. Additionally, she is the co-founder of the Firefly Alliance, a community that 
				develops collaborative leadership skills for women to move beyond racism and sexism. Aniyia 
				Williams not only has created successful businesses within the tech industry, but actively works 
				towards making tech responsible and prioritizing community, well-being, diversity, and 
				sustainability. 
			</p>

			<p> Aniyia received a B.A. in Music, with minors in Business and Italian from Penn State University, 
				and then went on to work in major gifts fundraising for arts nonprofits in the DC area, where 
				she met her husband. Her husband is a web developer who introduced her to tech, which inspired 
				her to find her own role in tech at a startup called Voxer. She left Voxer to pursue her idea 
				of Tinsel. Her experiences through this journey led to her personal understanding of the serious 
				inequities that exist for women and people of color in tech, and began her commitment to changing 
				the system of oppression and discrimination. 
			</p>

			<p>By contributing to bettering the tech world, Aniyia is constantly making progress to advance equity for 
				race, class, and gender in the United States and the entire industry. Additionally, her background 
				in music and creative industries is a powerful reminder that a traditional technical background is 
				not necessary to succeed in tech, as diverse backgrounds are an important asset in the tech space. 
				Her story inspires those who may not see themselves as 'tech people' to break barriers and create 
				their own path. She also inspires marginalized groups in the tech industry to continue to persevere 
				and succeed. She is a strong mentor by providing guidance to the startup industry while addressing 
				systemic barriers through many of her companies. By redefining success in entrepreneurship and advocating 
				for inclusivity and equity in tech, Aniyia Williams creates pathways for underrepresented voices to 
				lead impactful companies.

			<div class="column-right">
			<p> Recognizing her contribution to parent connection in public education, we chose Anupama Vaid as our second 
				tech hero. Vaid is the founder and current president of the platform ParentSquare. ParentSquare is a home to school
				connection platform for K-12 education. Vaid is a parent herself and realized while experienceing school life
				as both a stay-at-home mom and a working mom that there were missing links between the home and school connection. 
				This led Vaid to team up with her husband to create a platform that would transform the communication between caregivers
				and teachers along with making that communication more accessible.
			</p>
			<p> Anupama Vaid says that ParentSquare is more than just a communication channel. The platform allows parents to fill out forms,
				volunteer for events, and donate to the classroom. The platform also integrates student experiences from multiple schools
				making communication withini a family more connected. In addition to a direct messaging feature, there is built-in
				two-way translation for parents to be able to recieve all communication in their preferred language in real-time. They 
				can then reply in their preferred language and it will be translated back to the teacher. All of these features can be
				accessed within the app or without ever having to log in. The features are still useable within a basic email app.
				Anupama Vaid is not only making communication between caregivers and teachers more seamless but closing the digital 
				divide with these unique ParentSquare features. 
			</p>
			<p> Annie currently works in a K-12 school district and says that ParentSquare has personally made a difference in the connection
				she has with her classroom families. Previously working in a district without ParentSquare, there were miscommunications,
				periods of silence, and language barriers that were difficult to overcome. Now that her district uses ParentSquare, she
				has true connections with the families of her students. Through Vaid's intersectional lens, she has identified the issues
				that real families in America face (access to technology, various home languages, etc.) and used the knowledge to connect
				with all families. ParentSquare now reaches over 20 million students nationwide to close the gap and empower all families.

			<!--Jehron Petty - MAIN BIOGRAPHY--seperated in paragraphs as intended to easy style -->
			<div class="column-right">
			<p> Jehron Petty is a prominent leader in the tech space, using his platform to create a more equitable and inclusive environment for underrepresented groups in technology. 
				After graduating from Cornell University with a degree in computer science in 2020, Petty turned down a promising job offer at Google to pursue his passion for empowering others. 
				He founded ColorStack, a nonprofit startup designed to support Black and Latinx students in computer science.
				ColorStack connects students with mentorship, networking opportunities, and resources to improve their confidence and technical skills, helping them navigate the challenges of the tech industry.
			<p>
			<p>
				Pettyâ€™s vision for ColorStack grew from his own experiences at Cornell, where he observed his peers from marginalized backgrounds struggling to find success in a field dominated by white students. 
				ColorStack not only helps students develop technical expertise but also creates a sense of community by allowing students to contribute to real-world projects through an open-source product. 
				This practical experience helps build their portfolios, giving them a competitive edge in the job market.
				Petty is also passionate about using immersive technologies like virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) to break down barriers in education and create more inclusive learning experiences. 
				He sees these technologies as powerful tools for expanding access to opportunities that were once limited to specific communities.
			</p>
			</p>
				As Petty looks ahead, he envisions expanding ColorStackâ€™s reach, increasing the number of chapters at campuses across the U.S. and building stronger partnerships with tech giants like Google and Amazon. 
				Through his leadership, Petty is helping to shape a more diverse and inclusive future for the tech industry.
