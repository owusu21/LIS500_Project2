			<div class="column">
			<p> Inspired by her unique background in music, we chose Aniyia Williams as our first tech hero. 
				A creator, tech innovator and entrepreneur, Aniyia Williams is an inspiration who advocates 
				for racial and gender equity in the tech industry. Currently she is a director on the 
				Responsible Technology team at Omidyar Network, and works towards making the tech world 
				better for everyone.
			</p>

			<p>Prior to her current role, she founded a fashion tech company, Tinsel, in response to the 
				lack of electronics developed for women by women. She co-founded Zebras Unite, a movement 
				focused on creating a community for ethical and sustainable startups. She also founded 
				Black & Brown Founders, a nonprofit that works to help Black and Latinx entrepreneurs launch
				tech businesses. Additionally, she is the co-founder of the Firefly Alliance, a community that 
				develops collaborative leadership skills for women to move beyond racism and sexism. Aniyia 
				Williams not only has created successful businesses within the tech industry, but actively works 
				towards making tech responsible and prioritizing community, well-being, diversity, and 
				sustainability. 
			</p>

			<p> Aniyia received a B.A. in Music, with minors in Business and Italian from Penn State University, 
				and then went on to work in major gifts fundraising for arts nonprofits in the DC area, where 
				she met her husband. Her husband is a web developer who introduced her to tech, which inspired 
				her to find her own role in tech at a startup called Voxer. She left Voxer to pursue her idea 
				of Tinsel. Her experiences through this journey led to her personal understanding of the serious 
				inequities that exist for women and people of color in tech, and began her commitment to changing 
				the system of oppression and discrimination. 
			</p>

			<p>By contributing to bettering the tech world, Aniyia is constantly making progress to advance equity for 
				race, class, and gender in the United States and the entire industry. Additionally, her background 
				in music and creative industries is a powerful reminder that a traditional technical background is 
				not necessary to succeed in tech, as diverse backgrounds are an important asset in the tech space. 
				Her story inspires those who may not see themselves as 'tech people' to break barriers and create 
				their own path. She also inspires marginalized groups in the tech industry to continue to persevere 
				and succeed. She is a strong mentor by providing guidance to the startup industry while addressing 
				systemic barriers through many of her companies. By redefining success in entrepreneurship and advocating 
				for inclusivity and equity in tech, Aniyia Williams creates pathways for underrepresented voices to 
				lead impactful companies.
